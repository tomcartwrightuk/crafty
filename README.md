##Floader: A sample angular app for Rubyists##

This app is written for a talk I am giving/have given at the Feb 2014 London Ruby User Group lightening talks.
It introduces the conventions of angular through analogies that Ruby programmers will be familar with.

The app itself is a Flickr client that allows you to select photos to be downloaded with a click of a button to a folder on your server.
